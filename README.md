# Getting started

Take a look at the official libGDX [documentation](https://libgdx.com/dev/) on how to get started with libGDX and how to setup the project.  
Or just contact me at simon.dalvai@posteo.de, I'll help you to get started and update this README, so that others can also contribute. But until that doesn't happen, I'm too lazy to write a setup documentation.
